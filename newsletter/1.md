# SuperheroJS.com Newsletter #1: JavaScript Security, Browser DevTools & Deploying Large Apps

From our hollow volcano on Prototype Island, hello world! Now, for your consideration, here are the latest and most heroic articles on creating, testing and maintaining large JavaScript apps. 
 
After being bit by a radioactive web spider, we've unlocked the superpower of security, leading to a new section on how to write secure JS apps. We have an article on the basic principles of security by Grand Master Douglas Crockford, a cheat sheet for securing your apps from Erlend "The Lock" Oftedal, and a great book from the untangler himself, Michal Zalewski.
 
We also have a new video on developer tools from the evil geniuses at Code School, an article on deploying JS apps from Alex Sexton, master of builds.
