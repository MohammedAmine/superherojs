Contributing to Superhero.js
===

We at Superhero.js love Open Source and really appreciate pull requests with
great content. For this to go as smoothly as possible and to create a good
forum to discuss content and different resources, we need some guidelines.

## Superhero.js Vision

Superhero.js is not a collection of the latest framework tutorials. Instead we
focus on craftmanship and building a fundamental knowledge of the platform and
language. We believe this is the best way to learn how to build awesome apps,
and we also think it's essential to understanding and appreciating all the new
tools, libraries and frameworks that surround us. At Superhero.js we therefore
prefer resources that are general rather than about specific tools, libraries
and frameworks.

## Contributing Guidelines

* Each Pull Request should only contain one addition, change or delete.
* There shouldn't be any duplicate issues. Make sure to see already closed issues.
* Pull Requests with additions should describe why the resource is awesome and
  why it would be a great addition to the site. Please share with us what
  you learned from it and what others can learn.
* We will strive to keep the quality of our resources up, and with that we try
  to not have many overlapping resources. Maybe another resource is better than
  what we all ready have?
* Be amazing and help us create a great set of resources to help others getting
  into Javascript.


## Some Topics We're Interested In

We are always interested in getting pull requests with new resources, and maybe
replace some of our existing links, but there are a few gaps in our collection
that we are particularly interested in covering.

You can at any time see what resources we are currently actively looking for
by using the [`request` label in the issue list](https://github.com/superherojs/superherojs/labels/request).

Remember, if you are unsure if you got a good resource or you just want to discuss
some existing resources we are more than willing to participate in a discussion.
Just open an Issue! You can also send a mail at
[mail@superherojs.com](mailto:mail@superherojs.com) or twitter
[@superhero_js](https://twitter.com/superhero_js/).
